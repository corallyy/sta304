# Part 1 Abstraction
my abstract, We use @citetidyverse.
This research is designed to observe which crimes happened most in Toronto and the change rate of crimes.

# Part. 2 Introduction 
  The data set I used is “Neighborhood crimes rates” . this dataset record the numbers of six kinds of the crimes in different neighborhoods in toronto. These crimes are assault, auto theft, burglary, homicide, robbery and theft. With the different population of different neighborhoods and too many neighborhoods, what I focus on is the average number of different crimes per 100,000 people from 2014 – 2019 and the changing rate from 2018 to 2019 because they have the same assumption. What’s more I use boxplots to compare different crimes because it is clear to observe the mean value and distributions with boxplots.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("opendatatoronto")
install.packages("dplyr")

library(opendatatoronto)
library(dplyr)

# get package
package <- show_package("fc4d95a6-591f-411f-af17-327e6c5d03c7")
package

# get all resources for this package
resources <- list_package_resources("fc4d95a6-591f-411f-af17-327e6c5d03c7")

# identify datastore resources; by default, Toronto Open Data sets datastore resource format to CSV for non-geospatial and GeoJSON for geospatial resources
datastore_resources <- filter(resources, tolower(format) %in% c('csv', 'geojson'))



```

```
With the boxplot of the rate of every crime, assault cases has the highest rate among all the crimes with the highest mean value ,highest quantities and the widest distribution, and homicide witnessed the lowest rate. The second highest rate is the break and enter crime, namely the burglaries. And the auto theft witnessed the third highest rate among all the crimes. 

change<-subset(data,select = c(13,22,31,40,49,58),skip = 1)
boxplot(change)



with the boxplots of the change of every crime in five years, the mean value of change of crime quantities are almost around 0, so the crime cases keep in a certain level, with minor changes. However, some crimes witnessed the increasing more but others are not. In details,  more areas witnessed the increased robberies and theft cases from 2018-2019. By contrast, all the neighborhoods experienced the decreases in homicide. As to auto theft and burglary, the number of  neighborhoods experienced increases and decrease cancel out, so the mean values almost stays at 0. Compared to the previous two crimes, assaults witnessed the smaller distribution, which means the changes among the neighborhoods are similar.
